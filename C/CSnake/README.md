Simple snake implementation in C. Plays in the terminal.

The game was made for implementation on a DK3750 development board for a course i took at NTNU.

The final implementation used a gamepad and a driver for input. Here you need to use WSAD and enter to move the snakes.
There are no menues or anythng on this implementation either.
